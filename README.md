# lichess-bot

This is a [lichess-bot](https://github.com/lichess-bot-devs/lichess-bot) fork, but adapted to support
[my engine](https://github.com/Guilherme-Vasconcelos/chessy).

I have adapted the project to use pyproject.toml instead of requirements.txt, so in order to run it:

1. `python3 -m venv .venv`
2. `poetry install`
3. `poetry run lichessbot`
